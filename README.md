# Overview

Turn this **YAML** file:

    lib/exampleMessages.i69n.yaml
    
    button:
      save: Save
      load: Load
    users:
      welcome(String name): "Hello $name!"
      logout: Logout
  
Into these **generated** Dart classes:

    class ExampleMessages {
        const ExampleMessages();
        ButtonExampleMessages get button => ButtonExampleMessages(this);
        UsersExampleMessages get users => UsersExampleMessages(this);
    }
    class ButtonExampleMessages {
        final ExampleMessages _parent;
        const ButtonExampleMessages(this._parent);
        String get save => "Save";
        String get load => "Load";
    }
    class UsersExampleMessages {
        final ExampleMessages _parent;
        const UsersExampleMessages(this._parent);
        String get logout => "Logout";
        String welcome(String name) => "Hello $name!";
    }

... and **use them** in your code - plain and simple.

    ExampleMessages m = ExampleMessages();
    print(m.users.welcome('World'));
    // outputs: Hello World!

Package is an extension (custom builder) for [build_runner](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/build_runner)
(Dart standard for source generation) and it can be used with Flutter, AngularDart
or any other type of Dart project.

# i69n: 51 points simpler than your standard i18n!

## Motivation and goals

* The official Dart/Flutter approach to i18n seems to be ... complicated and kind of ... heavyweight.
* I would like my messages to be **checked during compile time**. Is that message really there?
* Key to the localized message shouldn't be just some arbitrary String, it should be a **getter method**!
* And if the message takes some **parameters**, the method should take those parameters! 
* I like to bundle messages into thematic groups, the i18n tool should support that and help me with it.
* Dart has awesome **string interpolation**, I want to leverage that!
* I like build_runner and code generation.
* I love the name. i69n is hilarious.

## Solution

Write your messages into a YAML file:

    exampleMessages.i69n.yaml (default messages):
    
    generic:
      ok: OK
      done: DONE
    invoice:
      create: Create invoice
      delete: Delete invoice
  
Write your translations into other YAML files:

    exampleMessages_cs.i69n.yaml (_cs = Czech translation)
    
    generic:    
      done: Hotovo
    invoice:
      create: VytvoÅ™it fakturu
      delete: Smazat fakturu
  
... run the `webdev` tool, or `build_runner` directly, and use your messages like this:

    ExampleMessages m = ExampleMessages();
    print(m.generic.ok); // output: OK
    print(m.generic.done); // output: DONE
    
    m = ExampleMessages_cs();
    print(m.generic.ok); // output: OK
    print(m.generic.done); // output: Hotovo
    
## Parameters and pluralization

The implementation is VERY straightforward, which allows you to do all sorts of crazy stuff:

    invoice:
      create: Create invoice
      delete: Delete invoice
      help: "Use this function
      to generate new invoices and stuff.
      Awesome!"
      count(int cnt): "You have created $cnt ${_plural(cnt, one:'invoice', many:'invoices')}."
    apples:
      _apples(int cnt): "${_plural(cnt, one:'apple', many:'apples')}"
      count(int cnt): "You have eaten $cnt ${_apples(cnt)}."
      
Now see the generated classes: 

    class ExampleMessages {
        const ExampleMessages();
        InvoiceExampleMessages get invoice => InvoiceExampleMessages(this);        
        ApplesExampleMessages get apples => ApplesExampleMessages(this);
    }
        
    class InvoiceExampleMessages {
        final ExampleMessages _parent;
        const InvoiceExampleMessages(this._parent);
        String get create => "Create invoice";
        String get help => "Use this function to generate new invoices and stuff. Awesome!";
        String get delete => "Delete invoice";
        String count(int cnt) => "You have created $cnt ${_plural(cnt, one:'invoice', many:'invoices')}.";
    }
    
    class ApplesExampleMessages {
        final ExampleMessages _parent;
        const ApplesExampleMessages(this._parent);
        String _apples(int cnt) => "${_plural(cnt, one:'apple', many:'apples')}";
        String count(int cnt) => "You have eaten $cnt ${_apples(cnt)}.";
    }         
    
See how you can **reuse** the pluralization of `_apples(int cnt)`? ðŸ’¯!!!

There are three functions you can use in your message:

    String _plural(int count, {String zero, String one, String two, String few, String many, String other})

    String _cardinal(int count, {String zero, String one, String two, String few, String many, String other})

    String _ordinal(int count, {String zero, String one, String two, String few, String many, String other})

`_plural` and `_cardinal` do the same. I just felt that `_plural`
 is a little bit less scary name and in most cases that's the one you need.

We need only two forms of the word "apple" in English. "Apple" (one) and "apples" (many).
But in Czech, we need three:

    apples:
      _apples(int cnt): "${_plural(cnt, one:'jablko', few: 'jablka', many:'jablek')}"

## How to use generated classes

How to decide what translation to use (ExampleMessages_cs?, ExampleMessages_hu?) **is up to you**.
The package simply generates message classes, that's all.

    import 'exampleMessages.i69n.dart';
    import 'exampleMessages_cs.i69n.dart' deferred as cs;
    
    void main() async {
      ExampleMessages m = ExampleMessages();
      print(m.apples.count(1));
      print(m.apples.count(2));
      print(m.apples.count(5));
    
      await cs.loadLibrary();
      m = cs.ExampleMessages_cs(); // see? ExampleMessages_cs extends ExampleMessages
      print(m.apples.count(1));
      print(m.apples.count(2));
      print(m.apples.count(5));    
    }    
                      
Where and how to store instances of these message classes - 
again, **up to you**. I would consider ScopedModel for Flutter and registering
messages instance into dependency injection in AngularDart.

But in this case a singleton would be acceptable also.

## Dynamic access using String keys

It's still useful to access your messages using the String keys in some cases. For example when the key
of the message is composed dynamically at runtime, maybe like this:

    var vehicleTypeMessageKey = "VehicleType.${data['type']'}";
 
You can access your messages like this:

    print("static:  "+m.generic.ok);
    print("dynamic: "+m.generic['ok']);
    print("or even: "+m['generic.ok']);
     

## How to use with Flutter

Create YAML file with your messages, for example:

    lib/messages/foo.i69n.yaml

Add `build_runner` as a dev_dependency and `i69n` as a dependency to `pubspec.yaml`:

    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      i69n: any
      ...
    
    dev_dependencies:
      build_runner: any
      flutter_test:
        sdk: flutter
 
Open a terminal and in the root of your Flutter project run:

    flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
    
... and keep it running. Your message classes will appear next to YAML files and will be
rebuilt automatically each time you change the source YAML.

For one-time (re)build of your messages run:

    flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   
Import generated messages and use them:

    import 'packages:my_app/messages/foo.i69n.dart'
    
    ...
    
    Foo m = Foo();
    return Text(m.bar);
    ...
    
## How to use with AngularDart

You are probably using `webdev` tool already, so you just need to add `i69n`
 as a dependency and **that's all**.          

## Custom pluralization

The package can correctly decide between 'one', 'few', 'many', etc. only for
English and Czech (for now). But you can easily plug your own language,
see [example/main.dart](example/main.dart)
and [Czech](lib/src/cs.dart) and [English](lib/src/en.dart)
implementation.

If you implement support for your language, please let me know,
 I'll gladly embed it into the package. 
 
# TODO

* Current limitation: default language must be english
* TODO: support custom imports

# Example

See [example](example). Clone the package repository ([https://github.com/fnx-io/i69n](https://github.com/fnx-io/i69n)) and run:

    webdev serve example:8080

or

    pub run build_runner serve example:8080

Now open the browser http://localhost:8080/ and watch the dev tools console.
